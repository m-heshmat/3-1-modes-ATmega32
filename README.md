# 3*1 modes ATmega32

This project is developed for embedded systems using the ATMEGA32 microcontroller. The project has features three main modes: Calculator, Timer, and Stopwatch. Additionally, it utilizes a keypad for numeric inputs and push buttons to switch between modes.



**Features**

•	Operational modes
1.	Calculator Mode: Allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations with two numbers and various operators (+, -, /, *, =). Inputs are obtained through a keypad, and the LCD displays the numbers, operator, and the result.
2.	Timer Mode: Enables users to set a countdown timer using the keypad. The timer starts when the 'D' button is pressed and triggers a buzzer when it reaches zero. The LCD displays the timer in the format "MM:SS."
3.	Stopwatch Mode: Provides a stopwatch functionality with start, pause, and reset buttons. The stopwatch increments and displays the time in "MM:SS" format on the LCD.


**Hardware**
